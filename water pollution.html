 <p><b>Water pollution is the contamination of water sources by substances which make the water unusable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming, and other activities. Pollutants include chemicals, trash, bacteria, and parasites. All forms of pollution eventually make their way to water.</b></p>  
 <h3>Causes of Water Pollution</h3>
 <ol>
    <li><b>Pathogens:</b></li>
    <ul><li>One of the most severe pollutants is the disease-causing microorganisms called pathogens. Pathogens are mostly bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Although bacteria are considered harmless if not beneficial, there are a few pathogenic bacteria as well, which enter the water bodies through sewers and sanitation systems. The water-borne pathogens cause several diseases such as diarrhoea, gastrointestinal illness, etc.</li></ul>
    <li><b>Organic Wastes:</b></li>
    <ul><li>Organic water pollutants include food waste, detergents, leaves, grass, etc. They originate from domestic sewage, discharge from food processing factories and farm wastes that reach the water sources through runoff and pollute them. It is a fact that bacteria decompose complex organic matter into the simple organic matter.</li></ul>
    <li><b>Chemical Pollutants:</b></li>
    <ul><li>Chemical pollutants include heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, etc., solvents from industries, pesticide run-offs, oil spills from ships, etc. They are poisonous to aquatic life forms and cause infertility and death. The metal wastes are dangerous to humans as well when they get absorbed in our body. They can damage the nervous system, kidneys, etc</li></ul>
