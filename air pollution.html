    <p><b>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere.<br>There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.</b></p>
    <h3>CAUSES OF AIR POLLUTION</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Burning of Fossil Fuels:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Automobiles:</b></li>
        <ul><li>The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.</li></ul>
        <li><b>Agricultural Activities:</b></li>
        <ul><li>Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it.</li></ul>
        <li><b>Factories and Industries:</b></li>
        <ul><li>Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality</li></ul>
        <li><b>Mining Activities:</b></li>
        <ul><li>In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air, but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas.</li></ul>
        <li><b>Domestic Sources:</b></li>
        <ul><li>The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing.</li></ul>
